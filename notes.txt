Notes and comments on this SMT hotplate project.

The Arduino code came from Jim Larson:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Closing-the-Loop-on-Surface-Mount-Soldering/step2/Software-for-Control

Which was in turn was derived from:
http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/BarebonesPIDForEspresso

The pyton UI code is a hack job derived from multiple matplotlib samples (too
many for a clean attribution).

1- Elite ESB 301-F single burner hot plate from Fred Meyer.
25A SSR such as http://www.futurlec.com/Relays/SSR25Apr.shtml


notes:
1) IR temperature sensor likes 3.3V power but its digital IO is 5V tolerant.
2) I think the PID loop could be replaced with a Kalman or something that
understands thermal physics a bit. 
3) I wonder how much of the thermal properties can be measured from this
configuration? 

HW mods:
I pulled apart the IR sensor and removed the laser pointer and added a
jumper block of 5 pins to the "A G C D V" pin holes at the back of the sensor
board.  I connected these in the following way:
A - teensy grnd
G - 3.3v LDO GND 
C - teensy D1
D - teensy D0
V - 3.3V LDO Vout

The LDO was powered by the teensy 5V and gnd pins.

The SSR was spliced into the BLACK wire of a common power strip and its
-4 post wired to the teensy gnd, and the 3+ post to PIN_D6 on the teensy
