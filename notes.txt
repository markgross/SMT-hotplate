Notes and comments on this SMT hotplate project.

1) IR temperature sensor likes 3.3V power but its digital IO is 5V tolerant.
2) I think the PID loop could be replaces with a Kalman or something that
understands thermal physics a bit. 
3) I wonder how much of the thermal properties can be measured from this
configuration?
